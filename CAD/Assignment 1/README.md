#Quine-McCluskey Method

####Problem Descriptions:
Implement a two-level logic optimizer based on Quine-McCluskey method. 
The first step is to generate all prime implicants for the given function. 
The second step is to choose a minimum-cost cover and generate a sum-of-products expression of this function with minimum number of prime implicant
(If there exist different solutions with the same minimum number of prime implicant, please choose the one which has minimum number of literals)
