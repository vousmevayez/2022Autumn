# Quine-McCluskey Method

#### Problem Descriptions:
1. Implement a two-level logic optimizer based on Quine-McCluskey method. 
2. The first step is to generate all prime implicants for the given function. 
3. The second step is to choose a minimum-cost cover and generate a sum-of-products expression of this function with minimum number of prime implicant
> If there exist different solutions with the same minimum number of prime implicant, please choose the one which has minimum number of literals
