# Timing Analyzer with False Path Detection

### Problem Descriptions:
1. Given a gate-level netlist and a cell library
2.Iimplement the three steps below to show the longest delay time and their corresponding paths under a given input pattern.

### Delay Calculation:
1. Build the delay graph according to the given netlist
2. Calculate the delay and value of each node in the graph following topological order 
3. Output the longest and the shortest delays and their corresponding paths
