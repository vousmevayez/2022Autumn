# Fixed Outline Floorplanning

### Problem Description
1. This programming assignment asks you to write a fixed-outline floorplanner that can handle hard macros. 
2. Given a set of rectangular macros and a set of nets, the floorplanner places all macros within a rectangular chip without any overlaps. 
3. We assume that the lower-left corner of this chip is the origin (0, 0), and no space (channel) is needed between two different macros. 
4. The objective is to minimize the area of the chip bounding box and the total net wirelength. 
5. Minimize the cost
