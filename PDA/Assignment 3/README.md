# Multi-chip Partition and Placement 

### Problem Description
1. In this programming assignment, you would get a chip design and cell information with a global placement result. 
2. You need to align all standard cells to feasible rows and legalize all standard cells without overlap. 
3. You also need to minimize the movement of cells between global placement and legalized placement.
4. There are too many cells so placing them in one chip is not probable.
5. Therefore, you would get two chips to place the cells, meaning you need to partition cells into two groups before Legalization.
